# AGENTS.md

`@kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor` is an OpenClaw plugin that runs a local
`openclaw security audit`, sends it to the KiloCode Security Advisor API, and
renders the returned markdown report inline in chat.

- The default branch is `main`.
- Releases are gated on manual `workflow_dispatch` — never publish from a push trigger.
- All commits must be signed by the human user. Do not create commits yourself.

## Build, test, lint

- **Typecheck**: `bun run typecheck`
- **Test**: `bun test`
- **Format check**: `bun run format:check`
- **Format (auto-fix)**: `bun run format`
- **Version resolution (dry-run)**: `KILO_VERSION=0.1.0-beta.2 KILO_CHANNEL=beta bun script/version.ts`

CI enforces all three (typecheck, test, format:check) on every push and PR.
Run them locally before asking the user to commit.

## Changelog

**`CHANGELOG.md` is maintained by hand. Update it in every change that a user
would notice.** There is no changesets tool; the file is the source of truth.

When making a code change:

1. Add an entry under the `## [Unreleased]` section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Use the Keep a Changelog subsection headings: `### Added`, `### Changed`,
   `### Deprecated`, `### Removed`, `### Fixed`, `### Security`.
3. Write the entry from the user's point of view — what they'll see, not
   which file changed.
4. Skip changes that don't affect users: refactors, test-only edits, CI-only
   edits, internal doc updates. When in doubt, add it; noise is cheaper than
   missing entries.

When cutting a release:

1. Move everything under `## [Unreleased]` into a new `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   section.
2. Leave the empty `## [Unreleased]` heading in place for future entries.
3. Add a new compare-link at the bottom of the file.
4. Commit the changelog update alongside the version bump.

The `files` array in `package.json` includes `CHANGELOG.md`, so it ships in
the published tarball.

## Release flow

Releases are triggered manually from GitHub Actions → `publish` workflow →
"Run workflow". Two common paths:

- **Explicit version (today's path)**: dispatch with `version=0.1.0-beta.2`,
  `channel=beta`, leave bump blank. Use this for pre-release / beta / rc cuts.
- **Auto-bump stable**: dispatch with `bump=patch|minor|major`, leave version
  blank, leave channel blank. CI queries the highest existing `vX.Y.Z` tag on
  the repo, bumps it, publishes to the `latest` npm dist-tag.

`script/version.ts` handles both. See the top-of-file docstring for full env
var semantics. The workflow fails fast if the target tag already exists on
GitHub.

### Branch protection and the release commit

The publish workflow's final step pushes a `release: vX.Y.Z` commit + tag
directly to `main` as `github-actions[bot]`, using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Once branch protection / repository rulesets are enabled on `main`, the
`github-actions[bot]` actor **must be added to the ruleset's bypass actors
list**, otherwise the release workflow will fail at the push step _after_
`npm publish` has already succeeded — leaving npm and GitHub out of sync.

This is a stopgap. The long-term plan is to adopt the same `kilo-maintainer`
GitHub App pattern used by the kilocode monorepo
(`kilocode/.github/actions/setup-git-committer/action.yml`), which signs
release commits as the App and has explicit bypass permissions. That
migration requires Kilo-Org admin access to install the App on this repo
and configure secrets, so it's deferred until an org admin is available.

Until then, release commits:

- are authored by `github-actions[bot]`
- are unsigned
- bypass branch protection via the ruleset allowlist (not via an App token)

## Code layout

- `index.ts` — plugin entry point; registers `/security-checkup` command and
  `kilocode_security_advisor` tool; shared `runSecurityAdvisorFlow` handles
  all auth paths (env token, saved token, pending device auth, new device auth).
- `src/audit.ts` — runs `openclaw security audit --json`, parses + validates
  output, fetches public IP.
- `src/client.ts` — HTTP client for the Security Advisor API; throws
  `AuthExpiredError` on 401.
- `src/platform.ts` — detects `kiloclaw` vs `openclaw`. Kept separate from
  `audit.ts` so the plugin loader's "env read + network send" security
  heuristic doesn't flag the combined file.
- `src/auth/device-auth.ts` — `startDeviceAuth` + `pollDeviceAuth` helpers.
- `src/auth/token-store.ts` — persists auth token to
  `~/.openclaw/secrets/openclaw-security-advisor-auth-token` (mode 600) and
  patches `openclaw.json` with a `SecretRef`. Also manages the pending
  device-auth code file. `patchConfig` is covered by unit tests.

## Testing

Tests live under `test/` and use `bun test`. `bunfig.toml` preloads
`test/preload.ts`, which aliases the SDK virtual path
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/zod` to the real `zod` devDep so schemas can be imported
in a non-plugin-host runtime.

Add tests for new pure functions. Filesystem + network code is harder to test
and currently relies on the end-to-end docker loop described in the README.
