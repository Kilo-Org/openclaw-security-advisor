# Releasing `@kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor`

Releases are cut from the `publish` workflow in GitHub Actions. There is no
local release script, no automated release on push, and no changesets tool.
Every release is a manual `workflow_dispatch`.

> ⚠️ **Current state (as of 2026-04-17):** `github-actions[bot]` is not on
> the `main` branch ruleset's bypass list. As a result, **every stable
> (`channel=latest`) publish run will fail at the "Tag and release
> (post-publish)" step** with `GH013: Repository rule violations found for
refs/heads/main — Changes must be made through a pull request`. This is
> expected today; the failure mode is the one documented in
> [Scenario 4](#scenario-4-publish-succeeded-but-commit--tag-push-failed)
> below.
>
> **What to do after a failed stable run:**
>
> 1. Don't re-run the workflow. `npm publish` already succeeded and the
>    version is live on the registry. The git tag `vX.Y.Z` will typically
>    have landed too (tags aren't covered by the branch ruleset), even
>    though main's push was rejected.
> 2. Check what's actually missing:
>    ```bash
>    git fetch origin --tags
>    git ls-remote --tags origin "vX.Y.Z"                              # is tag there?
>    gh release view "vX.Y.Z" --repo Kilo-Org/openclaw-security-advisor # is release there?
>    ```
> 3. Create the GitHub release manually — this is the only step that
>    reliably needs to be done by hand:
>    ```bash
>    gh release create vX.Y.Z \
>      --repo Kilo-Org/openclaw-security-advisor \
>      --title vX.Y.Z \
>      --generate-notes \
>      --verify-tag
>    ```
>    `--verify-tag` makes `gh` fail fast if the tag isn't already on the
>    remote, instead of silently minting a fresh tag at the current
>    `main` HEAD (which can point the release at code that was never
>    published to npm). If `gh` errors out because the tag is missing,
>    push the tag to the commit that actually got published first. The
>    commit SHA is echoed in the `Tag and release (post-publish)` step's
>    log as `::notice::Built local commit + tag vX.Y.Z (<sha>)` — that's
>    the SHA the tag should point at. The workflow's
>    `Print recovery instructions on partial failure` step also prints
>    the full set of recovery commands inline in the failed run's logs,
>    so you can copy them from there instead of reconstructing by hand.
>    ```bash
>    git tag vX.Y.Z <sha-that-was-published>
>    git push origin vX.Y.Z
>    ```
>    Then re-run the `gh release create` command above.
> 4. Leave `main`'s `package.json` alone. `script/version.ts` computes the
>    next version from git tags, not from `package.json`, so main staying
>    at a previous version is cosmetic, not load-bearing.
>
> This banner can be removed once the ruleset bypass is configured (see
> [Branch protection](#branch-protection)) or the workflow is refactored
> so stable publishes don't push to `main` at all.

## Channels

There are exactly two channels and they correspond to npm dist-tags:

| Channel  | npm dist-tag | Purpose                                            | Version format |
| -------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `latest` | `latest`     | Public stable releases. The default `npm install`. | `X.Y.Z`        |
| `dev`    | `dev`        | Internal dogfood snapshots. `npm install …@dev`.   | `X.Y.Z-dev.N`  |

That's the entire surface. There is no `beta`, `rc`, `next`, or `canary`.

## Pre-flight checklist

Before clicking "Run workflow", confirm:

- [ ] `main` is green on all three CI workflows (`typecheck`, `test`, `format`).
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has the changes you're about to ship listed under `## [Unreleased]`.
- [ ] You know which channel you're targeting and which inputs you'll use (see paths below).
- [ ] The tag for the resulting version does **not** already exist on
      https://github.com/Kilo-Org/openclaw-security-advisor/releases.
      The workflow fails fast if it does, but check first — it's cheaper
      to pick a different bump than to recover from a partial publish.

## Cutting a release

1. Open https://github.com/Kilo-Org/openclaw-security-advisor/actions/workflows/publish.yml
2. Click **Run workflow** (top right).
3. Fill in the inputs — see paths below.
4. Click **Run workflow**.
5. Wait for the job to finish (typically 2–3 minutes).
6. Verify on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor)
   that the new version shipped with the right dist-tag.
7. Verify on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/openclaw-security-advisor/releases)
   that the tag and release were created.

### Stable releases (`channel=latest`)

For public releases that go to `npm install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor`.

**Auto-bump (the common path):**

| Input     | Value                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `channel` | `latest`                       |
| `bump`    | `patch` (or `minor` / `major`) |
| `version` | _(leave blank)_                |

The workflow queries the highest existing `vX.Y.Z` tag, bumps it, and
publishes. Example: highest stable is `v1.2.3`, you pick `bump=patch`,
the new version is `1.2.4`.

**Explicit version (rare):**

| Input     | Value           |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `channel` | `latest`        |
| `bump`    | _(leave blank)_ |
| `version` | `1.2.5`         |

Use this only when you need to skip a number or seed the very first stable
release (since auto-bump from a fresh repo would resolve to `0.0.1`, which
is rarely what you want for `1.0.0`).

### Dev snapshots (`channel=dev`)

For internal dogfood builds. Versions look like `0.1.0-dev.1`,
`0.1.0-dev.2`, etc. They publish to the `dev` npm dist-tag, so users get
them with `npm install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor@dev`.

**Continue current dev cycle (the common path):**

| Input     | Value           |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `channel` | `dev`           |
| `bump`    | _(leave blank)_ |
| `version` | _(leave blank)_ |

The workflow queries the highest existing `*-dev.N` tag and increments
the counter. Example: highest dev is `0.1.0-dev.5`, the new version is
`0.1.0-dev.6`. Same `0.1.0` base — only the dev counter moves.

**Start a new dev cycle (after a stable release):**

| Input     | Value                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `channel` | `dev`                          |
| `bump`    | `patch` (or `minor` / `major`) |
| `version` | _(leave blank)_                |

The workflow takes the highest stable, applies the bump, and seeds
`dev.1`. Example: stable is `0.1.0`, you pick `bump=minor`, the new
version is `0.2.0-dev.1`. Use this when you've shipped a stable release
and want to start the next dev cycle.

**Explicit version (one-off):**

| Input     | Value           |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `channel` | `dev`           |
| `bump`    | _(leave blank)_ |
| `version` | `0.3.0-dev.1`   |

Format must match `X.Y.Z-dev.N` exactly. Use this for the very first dev
cut (since auto-bump from a fresh repo seeds at `0.0.1-dev.1`, which is
rarely the version you actually want), or to manually skip ahead.

## After a stable release

1. Move the `[Unreleased]` entries in `CHANGELOG.md` into a new
   `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section.
2. Add a compare-link at the bottom of the file.
3. Commit these changes to `main` through a normal PR.

The publish workflow does not touch `CHANGELOG.md`. It only bumps
`package.json`.

For dev releases, **do not update `CHANGELOG.md`** — dev snapshots are
ephemeral and the changelog tracks user-facing stable releases only.

## What the workflow commits back to `main`

| Channel  | Commits version bump to `main`? | Pushes git tag? | Creates GitHub release?     |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| `latest` | Yes                             | Yes             | Yes                         |
| `dev`    | **No** (orphan commit + tag)    | Yes             | Yes (marked `--prerelease`) |

Dev releases create a tag pointing at an orphan commit (the package.json
bump made in the CI runner). The orphan commit is reachable through the
tag but is not on any branch, so `main` history stays clean. This is
intentional — dev publishes happen frequently, and committing every
`release: v0.1.0-dev.N` back to `main` would be noise.

## Recovery scenarios

The workflow's steps run in this order: install → typecheck/test/format
check → **verify npm auth** → resolve version → **publish to npm** →
**verify publish landed** → commit/tag/release. Failures get progressively
more dangerous the further down the list they happen, because side effects
accumulate. Recovery procedure depends on which step failed.

### Scenario 1: Failed before `npm publish` (no side effects)

Includes: install, typecheck, test, format check, verify-npm-auth, and
resolve-version steps. Symptoms: `bun install` errors, type errors, test
failures, prettier complaints, `npm whoami` errors, version.ts validation
errors.

**Recovery:** none required. Nothing was published, nothing was committed,
nothing was tagged. Just fix the underlying problem and re-dispatch the
workflow.

The most common subtype here is **bad or missing `NPM_TOKEN`**, surfaced
by the verify-npm-auth step:

```
npm error code ENEEDAUTH
npm error need auth This command requires you to be logged in.
```

Fix: add or update the `NPM_TOKEN` secret in repo settings (see
[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md#release-flow) for token requirements), then
re-dispatch. Nothing else to clean up.

### Scenario 2: Publish succeeded but registry verification failed

Symptom: `npm publish` reported success, but the post-publish
**"Verify publish landed on registry"** step fails after 3 retries with:

```
::error::npm publish reported success but VERSION did not appear on the registry after 3 attempts
```

Most likely cause: registry replication lag or a transient registry
issue. The version IS published — `npm view` just isn't seeing it from
the runner's resolved registry mirror yet.

**Recovery:**

1. Wait 1–2 minutes, then verify manually from your machine:

   ```bash
   npm view @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor@VERSION version
   ```

2. If the version IS on npm now, the publish was real. Manually create
   the tag and GitHub release per **Scenario 4** below — but **only the
   tag/release portion**, not the npm publish portion.

3. If the version is NOT on npm after 5 minutes, the publish actually
   failed and you can re-dispatch. (This case is rare; `npm publish`
   strongly tries not to lie.)

### Scenario 3: Publish + push succeeded, GitHub release creation failed

Symptom: npm has the new version, the git tag is pushed and visible on
GitHub, but the **"Create GitHub release"** step failed with a `gh`
error (rate limit, transient API error, missing permissions).

This leaves a "headless" tag — version is on npm, tag exists on GitHub,
but the GitHub releases page doesn't list the new version.

**Recovery:** create the GitHub release manually from your machine.

```bash
# For stable releases:
gh release create vX.Y.Z \
  --repo Kilo-Org/openclaw-security-advisor \
  --title "vX.Y.Z" \
  --generate-notes

# For dev releases (note --prerelease):
gh release create vX.Y.Z-dev.N \
  --repo Kilo-Org/openclaw-security-advisor \
  --title "vX.Y.Z-dev.N" \
  --generate-notes \
  --prerelease
```

The next dispatch will succeed normally because version.ts's tag-exists
precheck looks at GitHub releases — and the manual `gh release create`
above creates one.

### Scenario 4: Publish succeeded but commit / tag push failed

This is the most dangerous failure mode. Symptom: `npm publish` succeeds
(package is live on npm at the new version) and the verify-publish-landed
step passes, but the workflow fails at the **"Commit version bump (stable
only)"** or **"Tag release"** step with a `remote rejected` error.

Most common cause: branch protection on `main` does not include
`github-actions[bot]` in the bypass actors list. See **Branch protection**
below.

Recovery steps:

1. **Do not** re-run the workflow. The package is already published; a
   rerun will fail at the tag-exists precheck (after another version is
   resolved) or at the verify-publish-landed step.

2. **For stable releases**, create the version bump + tag locally and push
   them:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   # Bump package.json manually to the version that was published.
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "release: v1.2.4"
   git tag v1.2.4
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

3. **For dev releases**, create just the tag pointing at an orphan commit:

   ```bash
   git checkout --detach
   # Bump package.json manually to the version that was published.
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "release: v0.1.0-dev.6"
   git tag v0.1.0-dev.6
   git push origin v0.1.0-dev.6
   git checkout main  # IMPORTANT: get back to a real branch before
                      # doing anything else, or your next git operation
                      # will be from detached HEAD and may be lost.
   ```

4. Create the GitHub release manually (same as Scenario 3 above):

   ```bash
   gh release create v1.2.4 \
     --repo Kilo-Org/openclaw-security-advisor \
     --title "v1.2.4" \
     --generate-notes
   # Add --prerelease for dev releases.
   ```

5. Fix the underlying cause (branch protection bypass) before the next release.

## Branch protection

When branch protection / rulesets are enabled on `main`, the
`github-actions[bot]` actor **must** be added to the ruleset's bypass actors
list. Without it, the publish workflow's stable-channel commit step fails,
triggering the recovery procedure above.

> **Status today:** the `Main branch protection` ruleset on this repo
> (`Settings → Rules → Rulesets`) is active but does NOT include
> `github-actions[bot]` as a bypass actor. This is why the banner at the
> top of this document describes the manual recovery step as expected
> behavior for every stable publish. Two viable durable fixes, pick one:
>
> 1. **Add the bot to the bypass list** (Settings → Rules → the ruleset
>    → Bypass list → add the `github-actions` app with bypass mode
>    `Always`). Fastest; keeps the current workflow unchanged.
> 2. **Refactor the stable publish path** to match the dev-channel flow:
>    detach HEAD, commit, tag, push only the tag — never touch `main`.
>    Keeps the ruleset strict with no carve-outs; the trade-off is that
>    `main`'s `package.json` version drifts behind the latest release
>    (cosmetic only, since `version.ts` reads from tags).

Dev-channel publishes don't push to `main` (only push the tag), so they're
less affected by branch protection on `main` itself. The tag push still
needs to be allowed — most rulesets allow tag pushes by default, but if
yours blocks them, allowlist `github-actions[bot]` for tag operations too.

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md#branch-protection-and-the-release-commit) for the
longer-term plan to replace the bot bypass with a dedicated GitHub App.

## First-time releases (2026-04-15)

Today's first cut is to the `dev` channel.

| Input     | Value         |
| --------- | ------------- |
| `channel` | `dev`         |
| `bump`    | _(blank)_     |
| `version` | `0.1.0-dev.1` |

The explicit version is required because auto-bump from a fresh repo
(no prior tags) would resolve to `0.0.1-dev.1`, which doesn't match the
intended starting point.

This publishes `@kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor@0.1.0-dev.1` to the
`dev` dist-tag, creates the `v0.1.0-dev.1` tag (pointing at an orphan
commit), and creates a prerelease GitHub release. `main` history is
untouched.

Subsequent dev cuts can leave `version` blank — the workflow auto-bumps
the dev counter (`0.1.0-dev.2`, `0.1.0-dev.3`, …) until you start a new
dev cycle with a `bump` input.

### Known quirk: first-publish `latest` dist-tag

On the very first publish of a brand-new npm package, npm auto-assigns
the `latest` dist-tag to that first version, **regardless of `--tag dev`
on the publish command**. There is no way to prevent this from the
publish side — it's npm's behavior for ensuring every package has a
`latest` resolvable.

The publish workflow includes a `Reconcile latest dist-tag (dev publishes)`
step that runs after every dev publish. It tries to repoint `latest` to
the highest existing stable version. As long as no stable release has
ever shipped (the entire pre-stable phase, e.g. while you're iterating
on `0.1.0-dev.N`), the step has nothing to repoint to and emits a
`::warning::` annotation on the workflow run. **This warning is expected
and non-fatal** — it just documents that `latest` is still pointing at
a dev version.

Once you ship the first stable release with `channel=latest`, that
publish overwrites `latest` with the stable version naturally. From
then on the reconciliation step stays quiet.

While the package is pre-stable, end users **must** install the dev
channel explicitly:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor@dev
# or
npm install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor@dev
```

Plain `openclaw plugins install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor`
(no `@dev`) will resolve to whatever `latest` currently points at, and
since `latest` currently points at a prerelease, OpenClaw's prerelease
guard will refuse the install with a confusing error. See
[README.md](./README.md) for the user-facing install instructions.
