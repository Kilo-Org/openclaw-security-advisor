# Changelog

All notable changes to `@kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor` are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- First-time device auth no longer triggers a brief gateway restart after the token is captured. The plugin now registers `reload.noopPrefixes` for its own config subtree, so the SecretRef patch written to `openclaw.json` after device auth is classified as a noop by the gateway reload planner instead of falling through to the default `plugins.* → restart` rule. The security checkup report is returned in the same response with no connection interruption.
- Release workflow: consolidated post-publish git/GitHub operations into a single atomic step with retries, eliminating a race condition where the version bump commit and tag could be pushed separately. Registry verification is now informational-only and never blocks tag/release steps.
- Release workflow: added a `Reconcile latest dist-tag` step that automatically repoints `npm dist-tags.latest` back to the highest stable version after a dev publish, preventing npm's first-publish auto-assign behavior from routing plain `npm install` users to a prerelease.

### Documentation

- README install section now leads with the `@dev` install command and explains why the plain install will fail until the first stable release ships.
- RELEASING.md documents the first-publish `latest` dist-tag quirk, the workflow's reconciliation step, and what its expected `::warning::` output means.

## [0.1.0-dev.1] - 2026-04-15

Initial dev release.

### Added

- `/security-checkup` slash command and `kilocode_security_advisor` tool, both backed by a shared flow that runs `openclaw security audit --json`, sends it to the KiloCode Security Advisor API, and renders the returned markdown report inline.
- Device auth flow for self-hosted OpenClaw users: first invocation shows a connect URL + code; second invocation polls, persists the token, and runs the checkup in the same response.
- `KILOCODE_API_KEY` env var path for pre-authenticated environments (e.g. KiloClaw).
- Explicit `authToken` / `apiBaseUrl` plugin config for manual overrides.
- Auth recovery: expired tokens are cleared and the plugin falls through to device auth in the same response.
- Audit output validated with a Zod schema at the plugin boundary.
- Public IP detection via `ifconfig.me` with IPv4/IPv6 validation.
